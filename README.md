## üõ†Ô∏è GPO via Microsoft Live Response in MDE

### üéØ Purpose
Enable updates to the Local Group Policy Object (GPO) via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Live Response. This process is manual per device but does **not** require physical access.

---

### ‚úÖ Assumptions
- Target computer is online and accessible via Live Response.
- Required files are downloadable from the linked GitHub repository.
- Files will overwrite existing ones automatically; however, `registry.pol` must be updated when changes occur.
- The GPO directory is now **separated** from Sysinternals.
- A separate script manages Sysinternals updates to enhance MDE functionality.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Shortcomings
- A single `registry.pol` file is used, applying **machine-level** policies only (not user-specific).
- Prototype device has been configured to **ignore user configuration**‚Äîthis needs further validation.
- Reverting this change may be necessary, but current repository code remains unaffected.
- The file is publicly accessible; acceptable for now.

---

### üßπ Fixes Implemented
- Resolved all coding errors (my oversight).
- Addressed `secedit` database reset issue; added workaround code.
- Successfully tested on a **purged system** via both local execution and Live Response.
- Policies are now reflected in the **Microsoft Security Portal**, though propagation may take **6+ hours**.

### üìå Disclaimer
- I am **not responsible** if you implement this script on your machine.
- I am **not responsible** if your system is compromised after using this script.
- In short: **use at your own risk**.

---

### üîÑ Outstanding Items
- GPO configurations are **continually evolving**‚Äîexpect ongoing updates to the policy file.
